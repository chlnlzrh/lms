Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L001: What AI Changes in BA Work (from documenting → continuous orchestration)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L003: Prompt Patterns for BA (context, constraints, acceptance, evidence, risks)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L001: Problem Statements & Outcome Trees with AI scaffolds` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L003: Journey Maps & Service Blueprints with evidence annotations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L003: User Stories from specs with INVEST and risk notes` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L007: Versioning & Approval Workflows with immutable snapshots` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L003: Business Rules Tables & Decision Models (DMN-lite)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L005: Negative/Boundary Scenarios via evaluator prompts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L001: Glossary/Taxonomy/Ontology drafts with conflict checks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L001: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI skeletons from narrative specs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L005: Event Catalogs & Schemas (domain events)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L001: Low/High-Fidelity Wireframe drafts from stories` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L007: Feedback synthesis → backlog updates` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L005: Baselines & Snapshots with immutable hashes` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L001: Policy Q&A with citations inside specs (do/don’t examples)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L007: Reg Watchlist & change propagation to specs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L007: Certification/Sign-off workflows for numbers & narratives` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L007: Cost/Latency Tuning for retrieval pipelines` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L001: Requirement Quality Rubrics (clarity, testability, risk)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L007: Operational Runbooks & KPIs for automations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L007: Fitness Functions for domain rules` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L005: Portfolio Prioritization signals from BA artefacts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L001: Discovery→BRD→Stories→ACs for a new feature with citations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L007: Post-launch metrics & reconciliation requirements` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."
