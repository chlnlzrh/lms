Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L001: What AI Changes in HR (from transactions → intelligence-led, evidence-first operations)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L003: Prompt Patterns for HR (context, policy constraints, approvals, risks, next steps)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L005: HR Copilot Workbench: policy Q&A, letter drafting, case summaries, decision aides` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L007: Guardrails: PII/PHI/PCI minimization, consent, retention, redaction-by-default` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L001: SoR/SoE/SoI map (HRIS/ATS/LMS/Payroll) & golden-field contracts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L003\n- Lesson Title: Data lineage across HR apps; change reason codes & auditability\n- Module: M1 — HRIS & Data Governance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L003: Data lineage across HR apps; change reason codes & auditability` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L005: Consent & purpose limitation propagation across flows` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L007: Quarterly access recerts & anomaly detection` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L001: Lifecycle blueprint from req to alumni with policy overlays` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L007: Alumni & boomerang talent pipelines` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L001: Role-based preboarding kits & document packs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L007: Sentiment & activation signals (time-to-productivity)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L001: OKR scaffolds & role ladders (expectations by level)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L003: Evidence-linked check-ins & progress synthesis` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L001: Comp band retrieval & geo differentials (localization)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L003: Equity refresher/vesting policies & blackout rules` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L007: Privacy, insider, and trading policy reminders` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L005: Vendor handoffs & SLAs (TPA, carriers)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L007\n- Lesson Title: Evidence & notices schedule by jurisdiction\n- Module: M6 — Benefits & Leave\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L007: Evidence & notices schedule by jurisdiction` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L001: Time capture methods & fraud/buddy-punch defenses` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L003: Breaks, meals, and minor employees (jurisdictional)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L005\n- Lesson Title: Payroll interlocks (cutoffs, retro, adjustments)\n- Module: M7 — Time & Attendance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L005: Payroll interlocks (cutoffs, retro, adjustments)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L007: Audits & backpay risk detection` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L001: ER intake forms, triage & severity ladder` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L003: Evidence sources (email, chat, logs) with minimization` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L005\n- Lesson Title: Findings, recommendations & counsel review\n- Module: M8 — Employee Relations & Investigations\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L005: Findings, recommendations & counsel review` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L007: Retaliation safeguards & follow-up check-ins` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L001\n- Lesson Title: Policy canonicals & versions (handbook, code, safety)\n- Module: M9 — Policy Operations\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L001: Policy canonicals & versions (handbook, code, safety)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L003: Attestation campaigns & completion evidence` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L005: Effectiveness reviews & exception registers` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L007: Archival/retirement policies with redirects` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L001: Skills taxonomy & proficiency ladders` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L003: Credentialing & evidence capture (badges, projects)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L005: Skill adjacency & internal mobility matches` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L001: HC plan contracts: position, cost, timing, approvals` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L003: Scenarios (freeze, ramp, reorg) with CFO interlocks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L005: Attrition, retention & risk heatmaps` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L007: Executive plan narrative & trade-offs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L001: Metric catalog & data contracts (sources, owners, rules)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L003: Confidentiality bands & small-n suppression` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L005: DEI/Equity metrics with context & caveats` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L007: Reconciliation across reports & source-of-truth` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L001: Survey design (bias, anonymity, question banks)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L007: Governance, escalation & remediation playbooks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L003: Safety/OSHA incident intake & reporting` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L005: ERG frameworks & funding guidelines` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L003\n- Lesson Title: Local labor law constraints (probation, notice)\n- Module: M16 — Global HR & Mobility\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L003: Local labor law constraints (probation, notice)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L007: Remote/hybrid work policies & equipment` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L003: SLAs, escalation ladders & automation triggers` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L005: Chat/Email summarization & next-step drafting` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L007: Continuous improvement via pattern mining` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L001: Process candidates & risk screens (human-in-loop where needed)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L003: Approvals (DoA matrices) & evidence logging` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L007: Runbooks, rollback & business continuity hooks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L007: Ethics board & sensitive-use governance` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L001: Payroll cutoffs & retro rules with risk flags` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L007: Finance/HR monthly close interlocks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L005: References & case-study validation` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L007: Commercial guardrails & pricing analysis` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M23-L003: Usage/value dashboards & alerts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M23-L005: Vendor benchmarks, SLAs & renegotiation` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M24-L001: Policy canonicals & Q&A bot with citations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M24-L005: People analytics dashboard with certification gates` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.
