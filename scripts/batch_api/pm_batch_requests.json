Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L001: What AI Changes in Project Management (from tracking → orchestration)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L003: Prompt Patterns for PM Work (structuring asks, constraints, evidence)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L007: AI Guardrails for PM: privacy, client data, approval workflows` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L001: PMO Charter, RACI, and Decision Rights in AI Programs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L003: Golden Paths & Templates (status, risk memo, change request) with LLM fills` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L005: Policy Ops: escalation SLAs, comms SLAs, approval matrices` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L007: PMO Analytics: portfolio burndown, red/amber criteria, forecast drift` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L001: Problem→Outcome Framing with AI narrative scaffolds` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L003: Stakeholder Map & Influence Graph generated from comms history` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L005: Options Analysis & Trade-offs (cost/schedule/risk) with scenario generator` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L001: WBS from Epics/Features using patterns & past analogs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L003: Estimation Copilot: 3-point, reference class, calibration prompts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L005\n- Lesson Title: Monte Carlo for Schedule Risk; what-if simulations\n- Module: M3 — Planning\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L005: Monte Carlo for Schedule Risk; what-if simulations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L007: Plan Baseline + Change Control hooks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L003: Refinement with LLM: spec → acceptance criteria → test hints` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L005: Flow Metrics (CT, WIP, throughput) dashboards with anomaly alerts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L007: Cross-team Dependency Board with auto-pings` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L001\n- Lesson Title: Opportunity→Epic→Story decomposition prompts\n- Module: M5 — Backlog & Requirements\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L001: Opportunity→Epic→Story decomposition prompts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L005: Ambiguity Finder: “ask-backs,” edge cases, dependencies` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L003: Exec/Client Status (What/So-What/Now-What) generators` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L005: Objection handling playbook mined from prior threads` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L001: RAID taxonomies & severity ladders` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L005\n- Lesson Title: Issue SWAT: swarm routine, clock, and owner assignment\n- Module: M7 — Risk & Issue Management\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L005: Issue SWAT: swarm routine, clock, and owner assignment` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L007\n- Lesson Title: Post-risk learning loop → pattern library\n- Module: M7 — Risk & Issue Management\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L007: Post-risk learning loop → pattern library` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L001\n- Lesson Title: Quality bars by artefact (doc, design, API, data, UI)\n- Module: M8 — Quality & Testing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L001: Quality bars by artefact (doc, design, API, data, UI)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L003: LLM test-case generation with evaluator grading` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L007\n- Lesson Title: Release gate scorecards with stop/go rules\n- Module: M8 — Quality & Testing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L007: Release gate scorecards with stop/go rules` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L001: Trunk-based flow & branch policies in PM language` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L003: Change Advisory input packs auto-compiled` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L005: Feature flag rollout plans with kill-switches` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L007\n- Lesson Title: Runbook completeness & handover checklists\n- Module: M9 — Engineering & DevOps Interface\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L007: Runbook completeness & handover checklists` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L005: Action item quality & ownership tracking` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L007: Risk register auto-updates from incidents` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L001\n- Lesson Title: Reading SOW/MSA with a contract copilot (scope, SLAs, penalties)\n- Module: M11 — SOWs, Contracts & Change Orders\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L001: Reading SOW/MSA with a contract copilot (scope, SLAs, penalties)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L003: Change order generator with cost/schedule impact` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L007\n- Lesson Title: Client escalation ladder & comms playbook\n- Module: M11 — SOWs, Contracts & Change Orders\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L007: Client escalation ladder & comms playbook` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L005: Vendor utilization and idle cost heatmaps` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L007: Funding gates & business case refresh cadence` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L001: Model/Prompt/Tool taxonomy for PMs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L003: Hallucination risk and citation-first delivery in client artefacts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L005: Red-team & safety checks on AI features` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L007: Regulatory/contractual constraints awareness for PMs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M14-L003\n- Lesson Title: Automated definition checks (ACs, links, labels)\n- Module: M14 — Tooling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L003: Automated definition checks (ACs, links, labels)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L005: Cross-tool sync (design/docs/test) with integrity checks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L007: Risk/Dependency boards with alerts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L001: One-page executive status with leading indicators` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L003: Client-facing KPI pack (SLA/SLO, benefits realized)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L005: Demo storyline builder (value > features)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M15-L007\n- Lesson Title: Success stories & before/after baselines\n- Module: M15 — Stakeholder Experience\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L007: Success stories & before/after baselines` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L001: Role ladders & growth plans coauthored with AI` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L003: Onboarding playbooks (client/project/stack)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L005: Psychological safety & escalation etiquette` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L001: Data classification in artefacts (public/internal/client-confidential)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L005: Vendor/app risk checks before adoption` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L001: Persona-based training plans & labs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L003: Champions network & office-hours scripts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L005: Shadow-IT detection & replacement plans` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L007: Feedback loops → backlog intake & prioritization` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L001: Portfolio intake & triage with AI evidence` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L003: Capacity, budget & risk heatmaps at portfolio level` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L005: Program governance packs for ELT/Board` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M19-L007\n- Lesson Title: Rebalancing & kill/accelerate decisions\n- Module: M19 — Portfolio & Program Management\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L007: Rebalancing & kill/accelerate decisions` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."
