Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L001: What AI Changes in Sales (from activity → intelligence-led orchestration)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L003: Prompt Patterns for AEs (context, constraints, proofs, risks, next steps)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L005: Copilot Workbench: status drafting, risk scans, action synthesis, follow-ups` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology.

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L001\n- Lesson Title: ICP & Ideal Problem Profiles from customer corpus signals\n- Module: M1 — Prospecting Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L001: ICP & Ideal Problem Profiles from customer corpus signals` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L003\n- Lesson Title: Buying Committee map generation (roles, influence, power centers)\n- Module: M1 — Prospecting Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L003: Buying Committee map generation (roles, influence, power centers)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L005: Account Summaries & Hypothesis briefs (pain→value)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L007\n- Lesson Title: Prioritization: fit x intent x timing scoring\n- Module: M1 — Prospecting Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L007: Prioritization: fit x intent x timing scoring` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L001: Message frameworks (Problem-Agitate-Solve, What/So-What/Now-What)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M2-L003\n- Lesson Title: Personalization from public + first-party signals (with safe sourcing)\n- Module: M2 — Outreach & Sequencing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L003: Personalization from public + first-party signals (with safe sourcing)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M2-L005\n- Lesson Title: Anti-spam & compliance (consent, opt-out, audit trails)\n- Module: M2 — Outreach & Sequencing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L005: Anti-spam & compliance (consent, opt-out, audit trails)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M2-L007\n- Lesson Title: Sequencer copilot: adapt cadence to replies/intent\n- Module: M2 — Outreach & Sequencing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L007: Sequencer copilot: adapt cadence to replies/intent` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L001\n- Lesson Title: Frameworks (SPICED, MEDDICC, Challenger) with AI note-taking\n- Module: M3 — Discovery\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L001: Frameworks (SPICED, MEDDICC, Challenger) with AI note-taking` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L003\n- Lesson Title: Live assist: intent detection, topic prompts, timeboxing\n- Module: M3 — Discovery\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L003: Live assist: intent detection, topic prompts, timeboxing` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L005\n- Lesson Title: Risk register & next-step generator (owner, due date, impact)\n- Module: M3 — Discovery\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L005: Risk register & next-step generator (owner, due date, impact)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L007: Hand-off briefs for SE/Solution teams` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M4-L001\n- Lesson Title: Problem→Outcome→Evidence narrative scaffold\n- Module: M4 — Value Narrative & Storytelling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L001: Problem→Outcome→Evidence narrative scaffold` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M4-L003\n- Lesson Title: Case study retrieval & proof weblinks (with permission)\n- Module: M4 — Value Narrative & Storytelling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L003: Case study retrieval & proof weblinks (with permission)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M4-L005\n- Lesson Title: Visual standards & accessibility for exec decks\n- Module: M4 — Value Narrative & Storytelling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L005: Visual standards & accessibility for exec decks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M4-L007\n- Lesson Title: Executive summary & FAQ packs auto-assembled\n- Module: M4 — Value Narrative & Storytelling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L007: Executive summary & FAQ packs auto-assembled` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L001\n- Lesson Title: Rate cards & guardrails copilot (discount ladders, floor prices)\n- Module: M5 — Pricing & Commercials\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L001: Rate cards & guardrails copilot (discount ladders, floor prices)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L003\n- Lesson Title: Term sheet generator with optionality trees\n- Module: M5 — Pricing & Commercials\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L003: Term sheet generator with optionality trees` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L005\n- Lesson Title: Approval matrix & auto-routing (finance/legal/executive)\n- Module: M5 — Pricing & Commercials\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L005: Approval matrix & auto-routing (finance/legal/executive)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L007: Competitive/comparator pricing briefs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L001\n- Lesson Title: Objection library mined from calls/tickets (with rebuttal options)\n- Module: M6 — Negotiation & Objections\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L001: Objection library mined from calls/tickets (with rebuttal options)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L003\n- Lesson Title: Tactics detector & response prompts (anchoring, nibbling, budget)\n- Module: M6 — Negotiation & Objections\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L003: Tactics detector & response prompts (anchoring, nibbling, budget)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L005\n- Lesson Title: BATNA & walk-away criteria calculators\n- Module: M6 — Negotiation & Objections\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L005: BATNA & walk-away criteria calculators` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L007\n- Lesson Title: Final recap & commitment narrative generation\n- Module: M6 — Negotiation & Objections\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L007: Final recap & commitment narrative generation` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L001\n- Lesson Title: Deal intake forms with mandatory evidence fields\n- Module: M7 — Deal Desk & Approvals\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L001: Deal intake forms with mandatory evidence fields` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L003\n- Lesson Title: Exception workflows & approval chains\n- Module: M7 — Deal Desk & Approvals\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L003: Exception workflows & approval chains` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L005: Audit-ready decision logs & hashes` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L007: Renewal & expansion hooks set during new business` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L001\n- Lesson Title: Stage definitions & exit criteria with evaluator checks\n- Module: M8 — Forecasting & Pipeline\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L001: Stage definitions & exit criteria with evaluator checks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L003\n- Lesson Title: Forecast models (rep/manager/AI blend) with confidence bands\n- Module: M8 — Forecasting & Pipeline\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L003: Forecast models (rep/manager/AI blend) with confidence bands` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L005\n- Lesson Title: Coverage ratios & risk-adjusted pipeline\n- Module: M8 — Forecasting & Pipeline\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L005: Coverage ratios & risk-adjusted pipeline` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L007\n- Lesson Title: Executive forecast narrative (drivers, risks, actions)\n- Module: M8 — Forecasting & Pipeline\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L007: Executive forecast narrative (drivers, risks, actions)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L001\n- Lesson Title: Field contracts & definitions (source, owner, lineage)\n- Module: M9 — CRM Excellence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L001: Field contracts & definitions (source, owner, lineage)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L003\n- Lesson Title: Auto-enrichment (firmo/techno/intent) with consent & audit\n- Module: M9 — CRM Excellence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L003: Auto-enrichment (firmo/techno/intent) with consent & audit` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L005\n- Lesson Title: Playbook triggers (status changes, tasks, nudges)\n- Module: M9 — CRM Excellence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L005: Playbook triggers (status changes, tasks, nudges)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L007\n- Lesson Title: Health checks & dashboard standards\n- Module: M9 — CRM Excellence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L007: Health checks & dashboard standards` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M10-L001\n- Lesson Title: Meeting briefs from CRM corpus (goals, risks, asks)\n- Module: M10 — Meetings & Call Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L001: Meeting briefs from CRM corpus (goals, risks, asks)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M10-L003\n- Lesson Title: Moment tagging (pain, value, objection, next step)\n- Module: M10 — Meetings & Call Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L003: Moment tagging (pain, value, objection, next step)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L005: Relationship graph updates & sentiment trends` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M10-L007\n- Lesson Title: Accessibility & cultural considerations in comms\n- Module: M10 — Meetings & Call Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L007: Accessibility & cultural considerations in comms` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L001\n- Lesson Title: Trial/POC charter: scope, success metrics, timelines\n- Module: M11 — Trials & POCs\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L001: Trial/POC charter: scope, success metrics, timelines` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L003\n- Lesson Title: Evaluation plan & instrumentation (events, KPIs)\n- Module: M11 — Trials & POCs\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L003: Evaluation plan & instrumentation (events, KPIs)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L005\n- Lesson Title: Weekly exec brief templates with evidence\n- Module: M11 — Trials & POCs\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L005: Weekly exec brief templates with evidence` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L007\n- Lesson Title: Reference story & case study capture\n- Module: M11 — Trials & POCs\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L007: Reference story & case study capture` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L001: RFP/RFI/RFQ analyzer & compliance matrix` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L003: Security/Privacy clause detector & escalation rules` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M12-L005\n- Lesson Title: Vendor/Reseller/Partner alignment & paperwork\n- Module: M12 — Security, Procurement & RFPs\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L005: Vendor/Reseller/Partner alignment & paperwork` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M12-L007\n- Lesson Title: Submission quality checklist & rubrics\n- Module: M12 — Security, Procurement & RFPs\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L007: Submission quality checklist & rubrics` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M13-L001\n- Lesson Title: Account maps (org chart, initiatives, budgets, politics)\n- Module: M13 — Account Planning\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L001: Account maps (org chart, initiatives, budgets, politics)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M13-L003\n- Lesson Title: Multi-threading plans & warm-path intros\n- Module: M13 — Account Planning\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L003: Multi-threading plans & warm-path intros` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M13-L005\n- Lesson Title: Competitive landscape & flank strategies\n- Module: M13 — Account Planning\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L005: Competitive landscape & flank strategies` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M13-L007\n- Lesson Title: Quarterly account reviews with evidence packs\n- Module: M13 — Account Planning\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L007: Quarterly account reviews with evidence packs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M14-L001\n- Lesson Title: Handoff briefs (promises, risks, dependencies, commitments)\n- Module: M14 — Customer Success Handoff\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L001: Handoff briefs (promises, risks, dependencies, commitments)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M14-L003\n- Lesson Title: Onboarding plan generator (roles, timeline, artifacts)\n- Module: M14 — Customer Success Handoff\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L003: Onboarding plan generator (roles, timeline, artifacts)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L005: Adoption narratives & early warning signals` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M14-L007\n- Lesson Title: Case study co-creation workflow\n- Module: M14 — Customer Success Handoff\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L007: Case study co-creation workflow` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M15-L001\n- Lesson Title: Renewal radar (term, usage, value signals)\n- Module: M15 — Renewals & Expansion\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L001: Renewal radar (term, usage, value signals)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M15-L003\n- Lesson Title: Health→Risk→Action triage with triggers\n- Module: M15 — Renewals & Expansion\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L003: Health→Risk→Action triage with triggers` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M15-L005\n- Lesson Title: Executive value reviews (MBR/QBR) with citations\n- Module: M15 — Renewals & Expansion\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L005: Executive value reviews (MBR/QBR) with citations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M15-L007\n- Lesson Title: Churn/Contraction retros & root causes\n- Module: M15 — Renewals & Expansion\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L007: Churn/Contraction retros & root causes` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L001\n- Lesson Title: ABM target set & tiering rules\n- Module: M16 — ABM & Marketing Alignment\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L001: ABM target set & tiering rules` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L003\n- Lesson Title: Signal taxonomy (intent, engagement, product usage)\n- Module: M16 — ABM & Marketing Alignment\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L003: Signal taxonomy (intent, engagement, product usage)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L005\n- Lesson Title: Event strategy (pre/during/post) with AI kits\n- Module: M16 — ABM & Marketing Alignment\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L005: Event strategy (pre/during/post) with AI kits` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L007\n- Lesson Title: SLA on MQL/SQL/SAO definitions\n- Module: M16 — ABM & Marketing Alignment\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L007: SLA on MQL/SQL/SAO definitions` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M17-L001\n- Lesson Title: Competitor dossier generator with safe sourcing\n- Module: M17 — Competitive Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L001: Competitor dossier generator with safe sourcing` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L003: Pricing & packaging deltas tracking` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L005: Field intel capture & validation` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M17-L007\n- Lesson Title: “Don’t say / Must say” guardrails\n- Module: M17 — Competitive Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L007: “Don’t say / Must say” guardrails` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M18-L001\n- Lesson Title: Executive status format (what/so-what/now-what)\n- Module: M18 — Executive Communication\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L001: Executive status format (what/so-what/now-what)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M18-L003\n- Lesson Title: Visual standards & accessibility for leadership decks\n- Module: M18 — Executive Communication\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L003: Visual standards & accessibility for leadership decks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M18-L005\n- Lesson Title: Proof appendix (references, KPIs, quotes)\n- Module: M18 — Executive Communication\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L005: Proof appendix (references, KPIs, quotes)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L007: Follow-up tracker & commitments ledger` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M19-L001\n- Lesson Title: Data minimization & purpose limitation in prompts\n- Module: M19 — Ethics, Privacy & Compliance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L001: Data minimization & purpose limitation in prompts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M19-L003\n- Lesson Title: Legal/compliance watchlist & escalation\n- Module: M19 — Ethics, Privacy & Compliance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L003: Legal/compliance watchlist & escalation` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L005: Shadow-IT detection & replacements` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M19-L007\n- Lesson Title: Bias, fairness & accessibility in narratives\n- Module: M19 — Ethics, Privacy & Compliance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L007: Bias, fairness & accessibility in narratives` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M20-L001\n- Lesson Title: Partner mapping & value exchange canvas\n- Module: M20 — Partner & Ecosystem Sales\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L001: Partner mapping & value exchange canvas` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L003: MDF/funds usage narratives & proof` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L005: Multi-party deal hygiene & approvals` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9.

Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L007: Partner success stories & case studies` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M21-L001\n- Lesson Title: Sales AI stack inventory & safe use patterns\n- Module: M21 — AE FinOps & Tooling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L001: Sales AI stack inventory & safe use patterns` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M21-L003\n- Lesson Title: Usage & value dashboards with alerts\n- Module: M21 — AE FinOps & Tooling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L003: Usage & value dashboards with alerts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M21-L005\n- Lesson Title: Vendor risk, SLAs & exit plans\n- Module: M21 — AE FinOps & Tooling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L005: Vendor risk, SLAs & exit plans` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M21-L007\n- Lesson Title: Data contracts & integration hooks (CRM, CS, Finance)\n- Module: M21 — AE FinOps & Tooling\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L007: Data contracts & integration hooks (CRM, CS, Finance)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M22-L001\n- Lesson Title: Prospecting→Discovery→Proposal for a target account (citations, risks)\n- Module: M22 — Capstone\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L001: Prospecting→Discovery→Proposal for a target account (citations, risks)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M22-L003\n- Lesson Title: Negotiation plan & objection readiness\n- Module: M22 — Capstone\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L003: Negotiation plan & objection readiness` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L005: POC plan & success criteria with instrumentation` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M22-L007\n- Lesson Title: 90-day adoption/expansion plan & MBR template\n- Module: M22 — Capstone\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L007: 90-day adoption/expansion plan & MBR template` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."
