LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M0-L001\n- Lesson Title: What AI Changes in Talent Acquisition (from activity → intelligence-led orchestration)\n- Module: M0 — AI-Native TA Foundations\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L001: What AI Changes in Talent Acquisition (from activity → intelligence-led orchestration)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M0-L003\n- Lesson Title: Prompt Patterns for TA (context, constraints, proofs, risks, next steps)\n- Module: M0 — AI-Native TA Foundations\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L003: Prompt Patterns for TA (context, constraints, proofs, risks, next steps)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M0-L005\n- Lesson Title: Copilot Workbench: JD drafts, outreach variants, interview questions, recap notes\n- Module: M0 — AI-Native TA Foundations\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L005: Copilot Workbench: JD drafts, outreach variants, interview questions, recap notes` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M0-L007\n- Lesson Title: Guardrails: privacy, consent, sensitive attributes, approvals & redactions\n- Module: M0 — AI-Native TA Foundations\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M0-L007: Guardrails: privacy, consent, sensitive attributes, approvals & redactions` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L001\n- Lesson Title: Intake agenda & discovery script generator by persona/team\n- Module: M1 — Requisition Intake\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L001: Intake agenda & discovery script generator by persona/team` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L003\n- Lesson Title: Competency & level mapping (junior→principal) with examples\n- Module: M1 — Requisition Intake\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L003: Competency & level mapping (junior→principal) with examples` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L005\n- Lesson Title: Risk register: scarce skills, comp gaps, process debt\n- Module: M1 — Requisition Intake\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L005: Risk register: scarce skills, comp gaps, process debt` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M1-L007\n- Lesson Title: Requisition brief (one-pager) with citations & sign-offs\n- Module: M1 — Requisition Intake\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M1-L007: Requisition brief (one-pager) with citations & sign-offs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L001: Ideal Candidate Profile (skills, signals, adjacency)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L003: Competitor/org chart inference with safe sourcing` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M2-L005\n- Lesson Title: Seniority & ladder equivalence (title normalization)\n- Module: M2 — Market Mapping\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L005: Seniority & ladder equivalence (title normalization)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M2-L007\n- Lesson Title: Target list & channel strategy (events, communities, platforms)\n- Module: M2 — Market Mapping\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M2-L007: Target list & channel strategy (events, communities, platforms)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L001\n- Lesson Title: Outcome-based JD scaffold from success profile\n- Module: M3 — Job Descriptions\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L001: Outcome-based JD scaffold from success profile` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L003\n- Lesson Title: Skills taxonomy & must/optionals with proof tasks\n- Module: M3 — Job Descriptions\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L003: Skills taxonomy & must/optionals with proof tasks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L005\n- Lesson Title: Location/remote/hybrid language & legal caveats\n- Module: M3 — Job Descriptions\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L005: Location/remote/hybrid language & legal caveats` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M3-L007\n- Lesson Title: Versioning, watermarks & expiry policies\n- Module: M3 — Job Descriptions\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M3-L007: Versioning, watermarks & expiry policies` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L001: Boolean/semantic query generation with synonyms & exclusions` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L003: Passive vs active candidate channel plan` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M4-L005\n- Lesson Title: Events & communities calendar (meetups, conferencess)\n- Module: M4 — Sourcing Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L005: Events & communities calendar (meetups, conferencess)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M4-L007\n- Lesson Title: Source attribution & data minimization policies\n- Module: M4 — Sourcing Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M4-L007: Source attribution & data minimization policies` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L001\n- Lesson Title: Persona-based messaging frameworks (Problem→Outcome→Proof→Ask)\n- Module: M5 — Outreach & Sequencing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L001: Persona-based messaging frameworks (Problem→Outcome→Proof→Ask)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L003\n- Lesson Title: Personalization from public + first-party signals (with consent)\n- Module: M5 — Outreach & Sequencing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L003: Personalization from public + first-party signals (with consent)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L005\n- Lesson Title: A/B/C outreach experiments & lift analysis\n- Module: M5 — Outreach & Sequencing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L005: A/B/C outreach experiments & lift analysis` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M5-L007\n- Lesson Title: Sequencer copilot: adapt cadence to responses/intent\n- Module: M5 — Outreach & Sequencing\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M5-L007: Sequencer copilot: adapt cadence to responses/intent` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L001: Screening guide from success profile & rubric` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L003\n- Lesson Title: Knockout criteria & exception handling\n- Module: M6 — Screening & Qualification\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L003: Knockout criteria & exception handling` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L005\n- Lesson Title: Non-compensable bias guardrails & redaction tips\n- Module: M6 — Screening & Qualification\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L005: Non-compensable bias guardrails & redaction tips` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M6-L007\n- Lesson Title: Risk flags (gaps, visa, comp misalignment)\n- Module: M6 — Screening & Qualification\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M6-L007: Risk flags (gaps, visa, comp misalignment)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L001\n- Lesson Title: Panel composition & roles (coverage, SoD)\n- Module: M7 — Interview Design\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L001: Panel composition & roles (coverage, SoD)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L003\n- Lesson Title: Calibration prompts & sample answers\n- Module: M7 — Interview Design\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L003: Calibration prompts & sample answers` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M7-L005\n- Lesson Title: Interviewer training packs & shadowing\n- Module: M7 — Interview Design\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L005: Interviewer training packs & shadowing` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M7-L007: Candidate prep packets & expectations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L001\n- Lesson Title: When to use take-home vs live task\n- Module: M8 — Assessment & Work Samples\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L001: When to use take-home vs live task` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L003: Accessibility & reasonable accommodation patterns` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L005\n- Lesson Title: Timeboxed designs & expectation comms\n- Module: M8 — Assessment & Work Samples\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L005: Timeboxed designs & expectation comms` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M8-L007\n- Lesson Title: Evidence storage, retention & privacy\n- Module: M8 — Assessment & Work Samples\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M8-L007: Evidence storage, retention & privacy` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L001: Calendar constraints & time-zone guardrails` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L003\n- Lesson Title: Reschedules, no-shows & SLAs\n- Module: M9 — Scheduling & Coordination\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L003: Reschedules, no-shows & SLAs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L005: Recruiter ↔ coordinator handoffs & checklists` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M9-L007\n- Lesson Title: Cost/time efficiency metrics for coordination\n- Module: M9 — Scheduling & Coordination\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M9-L007: Cost/time efficiency metrics for coordination` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M10-L001\n- Lesson Title: Transparent process maps & timelines\n- Module: M10 — Candidate Experience\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L001: Transparent process maps & timelines` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M10-L003\n- Lesson Title: Accessibility checks across touchpoints\n- Module: M10 — Candidate Experience\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L003: Accessibility checks across touchpoints` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L005: Feedback quality standards & templates` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M10-L007: Complaint handling & escalation guardrails` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L001\n- Lesson Title: Sensitive attributes & do/don’t sourcing examples\n- Module: M11 — DEI & Fairness\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L001: Sensitive attributes & do/don’t sourcing examples` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L003\n- Lesson Title: Structured screening & interview rubrics\n- Module: M11 — DEI & Fairness\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L003: Structured screening & interview rubrics` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L005: Panel diversity & interviewer rotation` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M11-L007\n- Lesson Title: Escalations & remediation narratives\n- Module: M11 — DEI & Fairness\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M11-L007: Escalations & remediation narratives` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M12-L001\n- Lesson Title: Lawful basis & consent capture in TA flows\n- Module: M12 — Compliance & Privacy\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L001: Lawful basis & consent capture in TA flows` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L003: Redaction/masking in notes, resumes & exports` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M12-L005\n- Lesson Title: Background check timing & compliance sequencing\n- Module: M12 — Compliance & Privacy\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L005: Background check timing & compliance sequencing` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M12-L007: Audit-ready logs & hashes for key decisions` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L001: Comp band retrieval & location adjustments` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M13-L003\n- Lesson Title: Pay transparency rules & posting requirements\n- Module: M13 — Compensation & Offers\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L003: Pay transparency rules & posting requirements` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M13-L005\n- Lesson Title: Negotiation playbooks & give/get ledgers\n- Module: M13 — Compensation & Offers\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L005: Negotiation playbooks & give/get ledgers` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M13-L007: Final offer letter assembly with citations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L001: Reference question bank tied to success profile` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L003: Education/employment verification flows` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M14-L005\n- Lesson Title: Risk signals & escalation paths\n- Module: M14 — Background & References\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L005: Risk signals & escalation paths` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M14-L007\n- Lesson Title: Privacy safeguards & candidate comms\n- Module: M14 — Background & References\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M14-L007: Privacy safeguards & candidate comms` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L001: Field contracts & definitions (source, owner, lineage)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M15-L003\n- Lesson Title: Activity capture & summarization with citations\n- Module: M15 — ATS/CRM Excellence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L003: Activity capture & summarization with citations` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L005: Data retention & redaction policies` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M15-L007\n- Lesson Title: Admin change logs & rollback plans\n- Module: M15 — ATS/CRM Excellence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M15-L007: Admin change logs & rollback plans` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L001\n- Lesson Title: Community segmentation (skills/seniority/geo)\n- Module: M16 — Talent Communities & Nurture\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L001: Community segmentation (skills/seniority/geo)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L003\n- Lesson Title: Event strategy (pre/during/post) & kits\n- Module: M16 — Talent Communities & Nurture\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L003: Event strategy (pre/during/post) & kits` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L005\n- Lesson Title: Warm-path intros & alumni networks\n- Module: M16 — Talent Communities & Nurture\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L005: Warm-path intros & alumni networks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M16-L007\n- Lesson Title: Conversion & yield metrics by cohort\n- Module: M16 — Talent Communities & Nurture\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M16-L007: Conversion & yield metrics by cohort` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M17-L001\n- Lesson Title: EVP narrative scaffolds & proof points\n- Module: M17 — Employer Brand & Content\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L001: EVP narrative scaffolds & proof points` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M17-L003\n- Lesson Title: Case studies & impact stories (with permission)\n- Module: M17 — Employer Brand & Content\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L003: Case studies & impact stories (with permission)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M17-L005\n- Lesson Title: Review site strategy & response playbooks\n- Module: M17 — Employer Brand & Content\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L005: Review site strategy & response playbooks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M17-L007\n- Lesson Title: Co-marketing with hiring managers\n- Module: M17 — Employer Brand & Content\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M17-L007: Co-marketing with hiring managers` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M18-L001\n- Lesson Title: Funnel definitions (views→applies→screen→onsite→offer→accept)\n- Module: M18 — Analytics & Funnel Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L001: Funnel definitions (views→applies→screen→onsite→offer→accept)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M18-L003\n- Lesson Title: Attribution & source quality diagnostics\n- Module: M18 — Analytics & Funnel Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L003: Attribution & source quality diagnostics` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M18-L005\n- Lesson Title: Cost-per-hire & time-to-fill dashboards\n- Module: M18 — Analytics & Funnel Intelligence\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L005: Cost-per-hire & time-to-fill dashboards` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M18-L007: Narrative packs for ELT/HR leadership` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M19-L001\n- Lesson Title: Hypothesis design (JD, outreach, scheduling)\n- Module: M19 — Experiments & A/B\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L001: Hypothesis design (JD, outreach, scheduling)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M19-L003\n- Lesson Title: Controlled rollout & holdout patterns\n- Module: M19 — Experiments & A/B\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L003: Controlled rollout & holdout patterns` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L005: Ethics & eligibility constraints` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M19-L007\n- Lesson Title: Decision memos & playbook updates\n- Module: M19 — Experiments & A/B\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M19-L007: Decision memos & playbook updates` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M20-L001\n- Lesson Title: Remote/tax/PEO/EOR basics & risks\n- Module: M20 — Global & Remote Hiring\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L001: Remote/tax/PEO/EOR basics & risks` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L003: Local labor law constraints (probation, notice)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L005: Data transfer & residency rules` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M20-L007\n- Lesson Title: Relocation policies & support\n- Module: M20 — Global & Remote Hiring\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M20-L007: Relocation policies & support` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M21-L001\n- Lesson Title: Candidate→ATS→HRIS sync contracts\n- Module: M21 — Integration & Automation\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L001: Candidate→ATS→HRIS sync contracts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M21-L003\n- Lesson Title: Outreach & scheduling automations with guardrails\n- Module: M21 — Integration & Automation\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L003: Outreach & scheduling automations with guardrails` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L005: Evidence packs & audit trails auto-assembly` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M21-L007\n- Lesson Title: Cost/latency budgets & monitors\n- Module: M21 — Integration & Automation\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M21-L007: Cost/latency budgets & monitors` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M22-L001\n- Lesson Title: TA stack inventory & safe use patterns\n- Module: M22 — FinOps & Stack Governance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: F (Foundation)\n- Estimated Duration: 45 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L001: TA stack inventory & safe use patterns` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M22-L003\n- Lesson Title: Usage & value dashboards with alerts\n- Module: M22 — FinOps & Stack Governance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L003: Usage & value dashboards with alerts` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M22-L005\n- Lesson Title: Vendor risk, SLAs & exit plans\n- Module: M22 — FinOps & Stack Governance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L005: Vendor risk, SLAs & exit plans` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M22-L007\n- Lesson Title: Data contracts & integration hooks (ATS, HRIS, email)\n- Module: M22 — FinOps & Stack Governance\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M22-L007: Data contracts & integration hooks (ATS, HRIS, email)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M23-L001: Handoff briefs (promises, risks, dependencies)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M23-L003\n- Lesson Title: Day-1/Week-1/Month-1 outcomes & owners\n- Module: M23 — Onboarding Handoff\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M23-L003: Day-1/Week-1/Month-1 outcomes & owners` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M23-L005: New hire surveys & feedback loops` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M23-L007\n- Lesson Title: ROI & retention dashboards by cohort\n- Module: M23 — Onboarding Handoff\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M23-L007: ROI & retention dashboards by cohort` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M24-L001: Intake & success profile with sign-offs` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M24-L003\n- Lesson Title: JD & outreach experiments (results & lift)\n- Module: M24 — Capstone\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M24-L003: JD & outreach experiments (results & lift)` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M24-L005\n- Lesson Title: Assessment, bias checks & evidence pack\n- Module: M24 — Capstone\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: A (Advanced)\n- Estimated Duration: 75 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M24-L005: Assessment, bias checks & evidence pack` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."

LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT_GENERIC.md — this defines the canonical 10-section structure.\n2. content_structure_ai-native-saas-curriculum-lesson-maps.md — this defines where the lesson fits in the broader curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### LESSON METADATA\n- Lesson Code: M24-L007\n- Lesson Title: Onboarding handoff & success measures\n- Module: M24 — Capstone\n- Subtopic / Focus Area: General\n- Complexity Level: I (Intermediate)\n- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes\n- Target Audience: Technical professionals and developers\n- Organization Context: Organizations implementing solutions\n\n**Prerequisites & Context**\n- Prior Knowledge Required: Basic understanding of the domain\n- Related Lessons: Related lessons in the same module\n- Domain Context: Technology and digital transformation\n\n---\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou must generate a **complete, polished lesson** following the exact 10-section structure of the template.\nEach section must be written in clean, engaging, professional prose using proper Markdown syntax.\n\n**Length & Depth Guidelines**\n- [F] Foundation: ~350–400 lines, 2–3 core concepts, 3 scenarios  \n- [I] Intermediate: ~400–500 lines, 3–4 core concepts, 4 scenarios  \n- [A] Advanced: 500+ lines, 4+ concepts, multiple scenarios  \n\n**Content & Technical Requirements**\n1. Include working code examples (≥15 lines each) demonstrating realistic SaaS architecture patterns.  \n   Languages accepted: TypeScript/Node.js, SQL, Terraform, or YAML.  \n2. Use real metrics and trade-offs (e.g., “reduces provisioning time by 60%”, “saves $50K annually”).  \n3. Anchor explanations in SaaS-specific terminology: multi-tenancy, tenant isolation, subscription models, usage-based pricing, CI/CD, and observability.  \n4. Connect code and architecture examples to common SaaS stacks — Next.js, Postgres, Vercel, AWS, and Terraform.  \n5. Discuss business impact, not just technology. Every technical concept must map to a measurable outcome (cost, velocity, reliability, compliance).  \n6. Avoid filler phrases (“learn about”, “understand”); use precise, action-oriented verbs.  \n7. Each code example must include a short contextual explanation and expected outcome.  \n8. Every section should open with 1–2 framing sentences that orient the learner before details or lists.  \n9. Use active voice, short sentences (under 25 words), and clear transitions.  \n10. Maintain tone balance: professional, instructive, and confident — not academic or conversational.  \n\n---\n\n### FORMATTING & STYLE GUIDELINES\n\n- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections. Capitalize key words.  \n- **Bullets:** Use `-` for list items. Avoid numbered lists unless order matters.  \n- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts`, ` ```sql`, etc.) and concise comments.  \n- **Tables:** Use clean Markdown tables with short headers; follow with 1–2 lines of interpretation guidance.  \n- **Callouts:** Use icons like ✅, ⚠️, 💡 for emphasis when appropriate.  \n- **Spacing:** Insert blank lines before and after headings, code blocks, and tables for readability.  \n- **Tone & Flow:** Alternate between explanation and application. Every theoretical statement should lead into an example or outcome.  \n- **Lexical Clarity:** When using technical terms (e.g., “tenancy isolation”), add a short clarifier in parentheses on first use.  \n\n---\n\n### QUALITY GUARANTEES\n\nYour final output must:\n- Contain all 10 sections from the template in order.  \n- Have consistent structure, formatting, and flow.  \n- Read naturally, as if authored by an experienced SaaS educator.  \n- Contain no meta-text, instructions, or placeholders.  \n- Begin immediately with `# Lesson M24-L007: Onboarding handoff & success measures` or the first section heading.  \n\nDo **not** include:\n- Any “LLM Prompt” or template boilerplate.  \n- Any context or metadata explanation.  \n- Any quality assurance notes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### FINAL OUTPUT\n\nDeliver the **final, learner-facing Markdown lesson**, cleanly formatted and publication-ready."
